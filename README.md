So far, this is the project that I learned the most from. Using Express and Mongo showed me how everything from the front end to the backend is connected and helped to ground the concept of the request response cycle. Moreover, I really enjoyed learning about authentication and creating users. I used bcrypt to create/login and found it very fascinating how passwords are hashed and salted before they eventually are stored in a database. This project also gave me a brief introduction to cookies and sessions which were great to learn about as I had heard about them for as long as I remember and never exactly knew what they were.
